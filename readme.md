This is a fork of the official AVA repository with a couple of [minimally invasive changes](https://github.com/andywer/ava-ts/pull/1). Uses `ts-node/register` instead of Babel. Not the cleanest solution, but it works well.


## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev ava-ts ava ts-node

# Using yarn:
yarn add --dev ava-ts ava ts-node
```


## Usage

Write your tests in TypeScript as you would usually do and import from `ava`, not from `ava-ts`, just as you would always do.

```typescript
// test.ts

import test from 'ava'

test('one plus two equals three', t => {
  t.is(1 + 2, 3)
})
```

Instead of running `ava`, just run the `ava-ts` CLI tool instead. That's it!

It will use all the same options and defaults you know from AVA, but searches for `*.ts` files instead of `*.js`.

```
$ ava-ts --help

  Usage
    ava-ts [<file|directory|glob> ...]

  Options
    --init                  Add AVA to your project
    --fail-fast             Stop after first test failure
    --serial, -s            Run tests serially
    --tap, -t               Generate TAP output
    --verbose, -v           Enable verbose output
    --color                 Force color output
    --no-color              Disable color output
    --match, -m             Only run tests with matching title (Can be repeated)
    --watch, -w             Re-run tests when tests and source files change
    --timeout, -T           Set global timeout
    --concurrency, -c       Max number of test files running at the same time (Default: CPU cores)
    --update-snapshots, -u  Update snapshots

  Examples
    ava-ts
    ava-ts test.ts test2.ts
    ava-ts test-*.ts
    ava-ts test
    ava-ts --init
    ava-ts --init foo.ts

  Default patterns when no arguments:
  test.ts test.tsx test-*.ts test-*.tsx test/**/*.ts test/**/*.tsx **/__tests__/**/*.ts **/__tests__/**/*.tsx **/*.test.ts **/*.test.tsx
```

## Documentation

See [AVA's official docs](https://github.com/avajs/ava) for detailed information.

`test.before()` registers a hook to be run before the first test in your test file. Similarly `test.after()` registers a hook to be run after the last test. Use `test.after.always()` to register a hook that will **always** run once your tests and other hooks complete. `.always()` hooks run regardless of whether there were earlier failures or if all tests were skipped, so they are ideal for cleanup tasks. There are two exceptions to this however. If you use `--fail-fast` AVA will stop testing as soon as a failure occurs, and it won't run any hooks including the `.always()` hooks. Uncaught exceptions will crash your tests, possibly preventing `.always()` hooks from running.
If a test is skipped with the `.skip` modifier, the respective `.beforeEach()` and `.afterEach()` hooks are not run. Likewise, if all tests in a test file are skipped `.before()` and `.after()` hooks for the file are not run. Hooks modified with `.always()` will always run, even if all tests are skipped.


## Limitations

There are a few limitations compared to the original `ava` CLI.

* No babel support
* No power assert


## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>How to use AVA-TS when the <i>module</i> compiler option is set to ES6 modules?</summary>

Especially when working with bundlers like webpack you will encounter this issue. Fortunately, there is a simple fix to make TypeScript emit node-style modules when running AVA-TS:

```sh
TS_NODE_COMPILER_OPTIONS='{"module":"commonjs"}' ava-ts
```
On Windows:
```windows
set TS_NODE_COMPILER_OPTIONS={\"module\":\"commonjs\"} && ava-ts
```

If you feel this use case needs to be improved, complain in [#5](https://github.com/andywer/ava-ts/issues/5) üòâ
